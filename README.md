# Web Development Repository
### Welcome to my Web Development Repository! This is a personal project space where I'm documenting my journey through the world of web development.


## About Me
### I've recently completed studying HTML and have created several projects that showcase my understanding of web structure and content.
### Now, I'm diving into the world of CSS to bring life and style to my web pages.


## HTML
### An introductory project where I explored the basics of HTML tags and document structure.
## HTML-Project: Starry-Bites-Cafe
### A webpage where I displayed all the things I've learned about html in the form of a simple project called "Starry-Bites-Cafe".


## CSS (In Progress)
### Currently, I'm applying CSS to to the webpages that I'm learning to make its visual appeal.


## Goals
### - To build a solid foundation in both HTML and CSS.
### - To create responsive and accessible web pages.
### - To start learning JavaScript after mastering CSS.

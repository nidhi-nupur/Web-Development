            <p>The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and development that defines how elements are rendered on a webpage. It encompasses the layout and design of each element, considering all the aspects that can affect its size and space on the page. Here’s a breakdown of the box model:</p>
            <br>
            <p>Content: This is the actual text, image, or other media content inside the element.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Padding: The space between the content and the border. It’s inside the element but outside the content.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Border: Surrounds the padding (if any) and content. It’s the edge that defines the element’s shape and can be styled in various ways.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Margin: The outermost layer, representing the space between the border and the other elements on the page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In CSS, the box model properties are used to create layout and spacing among elements. The total width and height of an element are calculated by adding up the width/height of the content, padding, border, and margin.</p>

            <p>Harnessing the Sun Solar power is a renewable energy source that converts sunlight into electricity. Photovoltaic (PV) cells, commonly found in solar panels, capture sunlight and generate electrical current. Solar energy is clean, abundant, and sustainable. It’s widely used for residential, commercial, and utility-scale applications, contributing to a greener future.</p>

            <p>Riding the Breezes Wind turbines harness kinetic energy from moving air to generate electricity. As wind blows, the turbine blades spin, driving a generator. Wind farms, both onshore and offshore, provide significant power output. Advances in turbine design and grid integration have made wind energy a reliable and cost-effective option.</p>

            <p>Flowing Water, Clean Energy Hydropower utilizes the energy of flowing water—rivers, dams, and tides—to produce electricity. Turbines convert water’s kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which drives generators. Large-scale hydroelectric plants supply substantial energy, while small-scale systems can power remote areas sustainably.</p>

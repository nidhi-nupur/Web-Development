    <!-- To align every tags in order, select the parts that needed to align (along with closing tag that needed to move) then press TAB. -->

        <div class="block left">Float</div>

        <!-- p*5>lorem20->Tab 
        When we expand ---p*5>lorem20---, we’ll get 5 paragraphs, each containing 20 words of Lorem Ipsum text (dummy text used as a placeholder) within each <p> element. Handy for quickly creating sample content! -->

        <p>The float CSS property allows us to position elements to the left or right within their container.</p>
    </section>
    <!-- <div class="clear"></div> -->
    <p>It’s commonly used for layouts where content should flow around images or blocks, creating responsive and dynamic designs.</p>

    <div class="block right">Float</div>
    <p>When an element is floated, it’s removed from the normal flow of the content but still remains part of the flow (unlike absolute positioning).</p>
    <p>Text and inline elements can wrap around floated elements, adapting to their position.</p>
